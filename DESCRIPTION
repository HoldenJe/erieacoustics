Description: A suite of tools used to standardize acoustic data processing
  and analysis across the multiple Lake Erie acoustic surveys. Tools are designed to work with
  a common file structure in place and interact with a licensed copy of Echoview. Analysis
  scripts are designed to work with common Echoview exports.
